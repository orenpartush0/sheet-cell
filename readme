README: Java Console Spreadsheet Manager
Project Description

This Java program implements a basic console-based spreadsheet manager that allows users to create, edit, and manage spreadsheets. It provides features such as:

Spreadsheet Creation: Users can create new spreadsheets by specifying sheet name, dimensions, and formatting options.
Data Editing: Cells can be populated with various data types (numbers, text, etc.), and users can modify existing cell values.
Formula Support: The program supports formulas within cells, enabling automatic calculations based on other cell values.
Version Control: The system tracks changes made to the spreadsheet and maintains different versions. Users can switch between versions to view historical data.
Data Persistence: Spreadsheets can be saved to and loaded from external files using XML and binary formats.
User Interface

The program uses a text-based console interface for user interaction. Menus are presented, and users enter commands or choices using the keyboard.

Implementation Details

ConsoleManager: Manages the user interface and handles user input in the UI module.
Controller: Controls the core functionalities of the spreadsheet, including data manipulation, version management, and file I/O, in the controller module.
Engine:The engine module is the heart of the spreadsheet manager, responsible for handling the core logic and data manipulation.

The program assumes users are familiar with basic spreadsheet concepts and navigation.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run the compiled program.
